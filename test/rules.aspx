       <h2 style="color:cornsilk;"> Rules that should be obeyed while driving a four-wheeler</h2>
        <p><b style="font-size:18px;"/>1) Do not drink and drive. It is one of the most propagated road rules, and every 
               responsible citizen should adhere to this, not just to avoid fines, but for their own safety.</p>
       <p> 2)Ensure that your vehicle is correctly registered and up to date with insurance policies. 
               Carry documents to prove this always, as you are required to provide these to an authority 
               whenever requested. Failure to prove the validity of your insurance status can lead to hefty
                fines and even court appearances in some cases.</p>
       <p> 3)Do not use your mobile while driving. Pull over and converse if it is an emergency,
                but never allow yourself to get distracted while driving as it can lead to possibly fatal consequences.</p>
       <p> 4)Follow lane discipline, and do not cut signals.
                Ensure you park in designated areas only, and always wear your seat belts.</p>

      <h2 style="color:cornsilk;">Rules that should be obeyed while driving a two-wheeler </h2>
         <p>1)Do not over speed or take part in a race, and do not encourage others to do so either. 
               A number of serious accidents in this regard show that it can lead to fatal situations,
               which could have easily been avoided.</p>
        <p>2)Wear your helmet and make sure your vehicle is up
               to date with safety measures. If you are found to be riding a vehicle that is not fit 
               for the road, heavy fines can be levied.</p>
       <p> 3)Ride with only one pillion rider at a time, 
               and ensure that the pillion rider adheres to all the safety rules and regulations as well.
              Failure to do so can lead to fines for not just the rider, but for the passenger as well.</p>
