            <p>
                Individuals whose driving licence has expired can apply for a renewal. They have to apply for a renewal within 30 days of the driving licence expiring. 
    The criteria for applying for a renewal of driving licence in Maharashtra is given below:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <p>The individual has to personally visit the RTO for the driving licence renewal process.</p>
                <p>Individuals who have been barred from applying for a driving licence cannot apply.</p>
                <p>A driving licence that has lapsed over 5 years ago cannot be renewed. The applicant will have to apply for a new licence, including taking the driving test.</p>
